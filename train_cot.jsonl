Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].  Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.  You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.\nCurrent Transcript: Student: Okay, so since this is similar enough to searching in a sorted array and we need this to work in log(n) time, then it figures that we can use a modified version of binary search. In normal binary search, we can assume that the middle index has a number greater than the current low index, but here we can't. So I can break it into two situations, if the usual condition of the middle index having the higher number then we use regular binary search. If not, then the rotation point is somewhere above the lowest index. So all we need to do is check if our low index is lower than the target, and if not we can move the low index past the mid point.

The solution has an extra line before returning the truth value which checks the truth value of the right and left subtree. The student code does not have this, and we can infer that the student is currently not accounting for whether the subtrees are unbalanced before determining the truth value. This check is needed for correctness as the problem stipulates that a tree is only balanced if all subtrees are balanced Hint: While you fixed your depth check, you need to think about how your current code returns up\nthe call stack. Specifically think about what happens with your code if the tree at the root is balanced,\nbut all the subtrees are not.
