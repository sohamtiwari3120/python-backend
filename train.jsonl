You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.\nCurrent Transcript: Student: Okay, so since this is similar enough to searching in a sorted array and we need this to work in log(n) time, then it figures that we can use a modified version of binary search. In normal binary search, we can assume that the middle index has a number greater than the current low index, but here we can't. So I can break it into two situations, if the usual condition of the middle index having the higher number then we use regular binary search. If not, then the rotation point is somewhere above the lowest index. So all we need to do is check if our low index is lower than the target, and if not we can move the low index past the mid point.

In normal binary search, we can assume that the middle index has a number greater than the current low index, but here we can't. So I can break it into two situations, if the usual condition of the middle index having the higher number then we use regular binary search. If not, then the rotation point is somewhere above the lowest index. So all we need to do is check if our low index is lower than the target, and if not we can move the low index past the mid point.
